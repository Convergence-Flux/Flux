# Flux Programming Language

Flux is a fully bare-metal, compiled programming language designed for low-level system programming, written **in Flux itself** and targeting a custom Flux ISA.

## Features

- Custom bare-metal ISA and runtime
- Self-hosted compiler, assembler, linker in Flux
- Bare-metal BIOS, bootloader, and operating system components
- Memory allocator, scheduler, shell interface
- Designed for embedded and OS development

## Getting Started

Instructions for building the compiler, assembling programs, and running Flux on supported hardware or emulator.
